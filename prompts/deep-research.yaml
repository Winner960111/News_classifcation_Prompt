  2. The possible (50% or more likelihood): provide an in-depth justification as well as describe the factors that could lead to this possible scenario along with the potential ripple effects.
  3. The Unlikely (10% or more likelihood): provide an in-depth justification as well as describe the factors that could lead to this less probable scenarios along with the potential ripple effects.

Same goes with the possible and unlikely scenarios and their respective time frames.  before completion check over that all of the tasks and fields have been filled out as detailed as possible with the necesarry data as opposed to an output like:
  '          "Unlikely": {
            "Description": "Unlikely",
            "Explanation": "Explanation"'
